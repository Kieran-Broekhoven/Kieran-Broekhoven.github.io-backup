                                <br><br>
                                I assisted development of a test automation framework for a real-time embedded system, creating new features and debugging failures.

At IGNIS I was primilarly focussed on application design.
                                <br><br>

I designed and developed several new controls in C# to expand the funcionality of the application. In OpenGL I expanded several existing features to adapt to the changing needs of clients.

                                <br><br>
                                At Clearpath I was a member of the Test and Infrastructure team, as a Test Engineering Analyst. My tasks were essentially to streamline or eliminate some of the more mundane or menial tasks of the test team. This included creating extensions to <a href="https://sentry.io" target="_blank">Sentry</a>, a crash reporting system, as well as several parsing and automation scripts. A significant project I completed was to design a failure monitoring system for Clearpath's robot fleet manager.

                                My day to day work often included assisting developers with running their builds, which entailed debugging and configuration of build systems.

                                My long term project was automating the process of moving virtual machine images from NAS (Network Attached Storage) to build agents (physical machines). 
                                The project was completed with a client-server application using socket programming in Python. I also utilized WSF, NSIS and other small tools to complete the task. I was also responsible for setting up a web service for the application using the company's Apache server.

                            For my second work term I travelled to China to do research in biomechanics. I was hired by Dr. Yu Jia to design and 3D print an ankle brace. I was working independently on this project, with support from other co-op students designing different braces. 
                            <br><br>
                            The purpose of the project was to design an ankle brace that could be customized to each patient. During production, each brace would be generated using medical CAD. This customization has the advantage of applying the necessary forces in a more accurate way.<br><br>
                            The design of the brace first involved processing the MRI images using MIMICS. The resulting STL images of the ankle were then used to build a brace around it. The final result was two nylon stabilizers on either side of the ankle preventing inversion and eversion.

                            I worked for the Systems Design Engineering department at UWaterloo for my first co-op term, from January to April of 2015. I was employed by Professor Bryan Tripp and supervised by graduate student Ben Selby. Our lab had the overall project of designing a robot that could intelligently navigate through a crowd. 
                            <br><br>
                            My position was to start the early stages of the project's software aspect. We worked on Clearpath Robotics' Turtlebot in the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS's navigation stack uses costs assigned to each point in 2D space to determine optimal paths, therefore we optimized this algorithm for crowd movement by assigning a greater cost to points in the path of moving objects than in their current place.
