                    For my fourth and most recent co-op term, I worked at <a href="http://clearpath.ai">Clearpath</a>, formerly known as <a href="http://clearpathrobotics.com">Clearpath Robotics</a>. Clearpath is a robotics company that focuses on autonomous navigation in industrial application as well as robotics for research platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    At Clearpath I was a member of the Test and Infrastructure team, as the Test Engineering Analyst Co-op. My tasks were essentially to streamline or eliminate some of the more mundane or menial tasks of the test team.

                    My most significant project was a robot fleet monitoring system. I designed a Django application that would poll a fleet management system and report back on it by notifying selected users of failures. 
                    <br><br>
                    I also worked on different extensions to the open source software <a href="https://getsentry.com">Sentry</a>. Sentry is a crash reporting system for Linux. I worked on extensions that would improve the notification system as well as the organization of the crash reports. Other tasks included log parsing and log generating.
